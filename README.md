## Landing pages **(You are here)**

We need an HTML page of sorts to explain what the archive is and what it
contains. This tool generates those HTML pages, based on an account's `index.json`.

This is a node/JS project.

``` shell
# install required software:
npm install

# start a local development environment
npm start
```

## Creating all the indexes

If you're happy with the code, there is a script to recreate account
index pagews wholesale. Run it:

``` shell
bash deploy.sh
```
